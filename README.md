JavaScript Basics: Session 2
📌 Overview

This session introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript programming, focusing on types and control flow. You will practice with variables, strings, arrays, loops, and conditionals through hands-on exercises.

📚 Topics Covered

Variables: Declaring, initializing, and understanding different variable types.
Strings: Working with text, including concatenation, properties, and methods.
Arrays: Creating, accessing, and manipulating ordered lists of data.
Loops: Repeating code blocks using for and while loops.
Conditionals: Making decisions in your code with if, else if, and else statements.

📝 Exercises
🔹 Variables

Declare a variable named userName and assign your name to it.
Declare a variable named age and assign your age to it.
Declare a variable named isStudent and assign a boolean value.
Log the values of all three variables to the console.

🔹 Strings

Create a string variable called greeting with the value "Hello, world!".
Create a new variable message and combine greeting with your userName variable to form a new sentence.
Find the length of the greeting string.
Convert greeting to all uppercase letters.

🔹 Arrays

Create an array named fruits with at least three different fruit names as strings.
Add a new fruit to the end of the array.
Access and log the second fruit in the array to the console.
Remove the last fruit from the array.
Log the final array to the console.

🔹 Loops

Using a for loop, iterate over the fruits array and log each fruit name to the console.
Using a while loop, count down from 10 to 1 and log each number.

🔹 Conditionals

Write an if statement that checks if the age variable is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, log "You are an adult." to the console.
Modify the previous conditional to include an else block that logs "You are not an adult." if the condition is false.
Write a new conditional that checks if the isStudent variable is true. If it is, log "You are currently a student." to the console.
