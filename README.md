JavaScript Basics: Session 2
# Overview

i this session introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript programming, focusing on types and control flow. You will practice with variables, strings, arrays, loops, and conditionals through hands-on exercises.

# Topics Covered

Variables: Declaring, initializing, and understanding different variable types.
Strings: Working with text, including concatenation, properties, and methods.
Arrays: Creating, accessing, and manipulating ordered lists of data.
Loops: Repeating code blocks using for and while loops.
Conditionals: Making decisions in your code with if, else if, and else statements.

# Exercises :
Variables : 

- declare a variable named userName and assign your name to it.
- declare a variable named age and assign your age to it.
- declare a variable named isStudent and assign a boolean value.
- log the values of all three variables to the console.

# strings

- create a string variable called greeting with the value "Hello, world!".
- create a new variable message and combine greeting with your userName variable to form a new sentence.
- find the length of the greeting string.
- convert greeting to all uppercase letters.

# Arrays

- create an array named fruits with at least three different fruit names as strings.
- add a new fruit to the end of the array.
- Access and log the second fruit in the array to the console.
- Remove the last fruit from the array.
- Log the final array to the console.

# Loops

- Using a for loop, iterate over the fruits array and log each fruit name to the console.
- Using a while loop, count down from 10 to 1 and log each number.

# Conditionals

- write an if statement that checks if the age variable is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, log "You are an adult." to the console.
- Modify the previous conditional to include an else block that logs "You are not an adult." if the condition is false.
- Write a new conditional that checks if the isStudent variable is true. If it is, log "You are currently a student." to the console.
